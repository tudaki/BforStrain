# BforStrain

Porting over code one at a time from MATLab to Python. Currently updated disloc3d.py 
to be more consistent with Python's object oriented code style. disloc3d_BAK.py remains 
as a direct port from the MATLab code and was initially used to confirm functionality.
both .py versions here produce the exact same results.
